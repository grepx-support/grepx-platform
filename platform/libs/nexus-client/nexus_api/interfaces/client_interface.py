"""ClientInterface — the operations a service needs against nexus_server:
INSERT, SELECT, SUBSCRIBE, SUBMIT (and TRANSITION, kept for lower-level
callers that already have an expected_version in hand). impl/nexus_client.py
is the concrete implementation; NexusApplication (application/) depends
on this abstraction rather than the concrete class, so it never needs to
know how a request actually reaches the server.
